## *[delicious content]*

#### Getting Started
1. To set up our website, we must first open a new code project. For this example I will be using Visual Studio Code.
2. In the first line, be sure to specify this project is and HTML project by using DOCTYPE html.
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```
  3. Next we will add a few tags. Be sure to include an html, head, style and body tag.
  ```html 
  <html>
    <head>
        <style>
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
